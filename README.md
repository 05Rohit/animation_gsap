# Animated Website with GSAP

-> GSAP is an industry standard JavaScript animation library from GreenSock that lets you craft high-performance animations that work in every major browser.

-> Why i use GSAP at place of css animation

   In case of simple css animation GSAP provide animation on the scroll means when particular section come in the viewpoint of thhe screen then 
   only animation will happen and for this things we use scroll-triger and locomotive library. And in case of GSAP we need to write less line 
   of code and it provide extra functionality and features which is not done by using Standard CSS animation.
